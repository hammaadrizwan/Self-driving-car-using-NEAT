# Self-Driving Car Using NEAT

This project implements a self-driving car simulation using the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm. The car navigates a predefined map while avoiding obstacles, using sensor data and a neural network that evolves over generations.


## Introduction

The self-driving car project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be used to navigate a car through a complex environment. This project uses the NEAT algorithm to evolve neural networks that control the car's movements based on sensor inputs. The goal is to train the car to drive as far as possible without crashing.

## Features

- **NeuroEvolution**: Utilizes NEAT to evolve neural networks over generations.
- **Real-time Simulation**: The car navigates a map in real-time using Pygame.
- **Sensor Data**: The car uses radar sensors to detect obstacles and make decisions.
- **Customizable**: The simulation parameters and neural network configurations are highly customizable.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Pygame
- NEAT-Python

## Usage

To run the simulation:

```bash
python algorithm.py
